Homework 2

Part A: Outdoor 3D Scene
This program creates a heightmap from an image in a skybox of San Francisco. Uses mouse to move through the scene (LMB to rotate, RMB to move, scroll to zoom). Use dat.gui to control the water level, clarity of the water to see underneath, detail of water's surface, and the size of the heightmap and water.

Part B:
A point sprite starfield with shooting stars that use GPUParticleSystem.js library. This library uses noise and applies a texture to the particles. Use dat.gui to control how the stars look. Use the mouse to move through the scene.
